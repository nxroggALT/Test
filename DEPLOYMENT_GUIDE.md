## ‚ùå Why Netlify Doesn't Work

**Netlify Issue:** Netlify is designed for static sites and serverless functions, not full-stack Express.js apps.

**The Problem:**
- Your app needs a persistent Express.js server
- Netlify only supports static files + serverless functions
- Your admin panel, database connections, and API routes need a running server

## üîß Quick Fix for Your Current Netlify Attempt

If you want to try Netlify anyway (not recommended):

1. **In Netlify Site Settings:**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist/public`
   - Node version: `18`

2. **The app will only show the frontend** - no admin panel, no database, no API will work.

## üìã What You Need Before Deploying

1. **PostgreSQL Database:**
   - Get a free database from [Neon](https://neon.tech) or [Supabase](https://supabase.com)
   - Copy the connection string

2. **Environment Variables:**
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your-postgresql-connection-string
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

3. **Your Repository on GitHub** (we still need to set this up)

## üèÜ Recommended Steps:

1. **Deploy to Vercel** (easiest for your React + Express app)
2. **Set up PostgreSQL** database
3. **Configure environment variables**
4. **Your Rain Esports site will be live** with:
   - Professional team website
   - Admin panel (password: Rain2025)
   - Discord integration
   - Global announcements
   - Database functionality
